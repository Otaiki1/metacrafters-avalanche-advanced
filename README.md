# Blockchain Vault Management System

This project provides a simple implementation of a blockchain vault management system using a Solidity smart contract. Users can deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens while maintaining a record of user balances and total supply.

## Description

The program incorporates a token smart contract and a vault contract. This alllows users have a token and a vault management system 
The project is used to simulate the workflow with an avalanche subnet . One has been created and this smart contracts were deployed on it.

* Copy the files to remix IDE

### Executing program

* Connect to injected web3 on remix
* Deploy on your subnet
* The contract has already been deployed on my subnet , you can add the following network parameters to confirm
